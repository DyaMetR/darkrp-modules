# DarkRP modules

A collection of modules, entities and weapons developed for a now defunct late 2020 Garry's Mod server running DarkRP.

## Prerequisites

1. Garry's Mod
2. [DarkRP](https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP)

## Installation

**Download ZIP** or `git clone git@github.com:DyaMetR/darkrp-modules.git`.

### Cherry picking modules

Most probable is that you just want to benefit from a handful of modules, in that case...

1. Create your own [DarkRP modification addon](https://github.com/FPtje/darkrpmodification) (if you haven't already).
2. Following the same folder structure, **transfer** modules or weapons individually.

   +   `igfl_` prefixed weapons **require** the `igfl_base` to work.

### Installing it whole

1. Place `darkrp-modules-main` inside your addons folder.
